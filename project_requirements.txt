CreditSentinel™
AI-Powered Loan Covenant Monitoring & Early Warning System

Executive Summary
CreditSentinel™ is a desktop-based AI system that automatically monitors loan covenants by
reading legal loan agreements and continuously comparing them against borrower financial data.
It replaces slow, manual covenant checks with an intelligent, explainable, and auditable process.
The platform helps lenders detect covenant breaches early, reduce operational risk, and keep
loans on track.

The Problem
Modern loan agreements contain dozens of complex financial covenants written in legal
language. Today, banks rely on analysts to manually read PDF contracts and compare them with
monthly or quarterly financial reports provided as Excel files. This process is slow, error-prone,
expensive, and often detects problems too late—after a covenant breach has already occurred.

The Solution: CreditSentinel™
CreditSentinel™ automates covenant monitoring end-to-end. A banker simply uploads the loan
agreement (PDF) and the borrower’s financial data (Excel/CSV). The AI system extracts
covenants, understands their meaning, evaluates them against real numbers, and immediately
reports compliance status, risks, and early-warning signals.

How It Works
Step 1 – Document Ingestion: The user uploads a loan agreement (PDF). The AI parses the
document, identifies financial covenants, thresholds, ratios, and reporting requirements, and
converts them into structured machine-readable rules.

Step 2 – Financial Data Analysis: The borrower’s financial statements are uploaded in Excel or
CSV format. CreditSentinel normalizes the data and calculates required ratios and indicators.
Step 3 – Covenant Evaluation: Each covenant is automatically evaluated against current
financial data. The system flags compliance, warning, or breach states.
Step 4 – Risk Forecasting: Using trend analysis, the AI predicts when a covenant is likely to be
breached if current performance continues.
Step 5 – Explainable Reporting: The system generates a human-readable explanation suitable
for bankers, risk committees, and auditors.

Technical Architecture
Frontend: Flutter Desktop application providing a professional, data-rich dashboard with PDF
viewing, charts, and alerts.
Backend: Python-based AI engine exposed via FastAPI.
AI Components: Natural Language Processing for covenant extraction, rule-based evaluation
engines, and statistical forecasting models for early warnings.
Security: Local or private-cloud deployment with no requirement to expose sensitive data
publicly.

Why CreditSentinel Matters
CreditSentinel™ directly addresses one of the most expensive operational inefficiencies in loan
markets. By automating covenant monitoring, banks reduce operational costs, catch problems
earlier, improve regulatory compliance, and maintain healthier borrower relationships. Unlike
black-box decision systems, CreditSentinel is explainable, conservative, and designed to
support—not replace—human judgment.
